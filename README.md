# Nmap-scanning-project
Aimed at identifying network devices, uncovering open ports, and checking for vulnerabilities.

### Step 1
To scan our devices(host) for open ports, we need to first identify its ip address.

**Procedure**
* Start NMAP from the CMD terminal or open Zenmap.
* Type "ipconfig". This will display all Ip addresses; and select the interface you are using, in this case, the wireless interface.
